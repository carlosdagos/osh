About
-----

Osh is a library that allows shell-like scripting in plain OCaml.

It's based on the following projects:

- https://github.com/luke-clifton/shh
- https://github.com/kowainik/shellmet

However, Osh also leverages the OCaml PPX system to provide an accessible
interface.

Developing
----------

I am happy to receive contributions. This project uses `lorri` and `direnv`
to support developers who are keen to help. Please see the related docs below:

- https://github.com/target/lorri
- https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html

The current status of this however is a bit limited, so there are no
guarantees that I'll keep this around.
